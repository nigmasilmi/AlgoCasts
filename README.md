## Dev notes

### Use debugger in node

- place the debugger statement in the code
- be sure to call the function or piece of code that is going to be inspected
- run the file with `node inspect the-name.js`
- `debug>`c to continue
- `debug>`repl to enter repl mode and inspect variables

### every() in JS

- array method
- checks if all return statements comply with a condition
  array => [1, 8, 34]
  e.g ` array.every(val=> val>5)` => returns false
